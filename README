I created 2 different programs, following the tutorial here: http://www.mastertheboss.com/jboss-frameworks/forge/jboss-forge-tutorial?showall=&start=1. This version uses JBoss Forge 1.x.x, which I was worried was too old.
I created a new program, mjvConference, through the JBoss tutorial here: https://forge.jboss.org/document/write-a-java-ee-web-application---basic.
It uses JBoss Forge 2.x.x. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns at: mvella@hawk.itt.edu.

I followed the insturctions explicitly, and want to acknowledge that I followed the tutorial in order to avoid mistakes. I hope this avoids accusations of plagirism. All credit for the code goes to the Master the Boss.com manual.
